# Twimba

This is an project from the Scrimba's Front-end career path. It is a twitter clone with reduced functionality. You are the user @batoussai and can add tweets to the feed. You can also commment on other peoples tweets and like other people tweets. The app fetches some dummy data from data.js and renders it on the app. I used localstore to have some persistence on the data, so if you add a comment or tweet it will not go away when you refreshed the page. If I have time, I will look into using something more robust like a proper database.
